      Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the
      related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from
      vespoid wasp ancestors in the Cretaceous period. More than 13,800 of Ants
      Temporal range: Late Albian Present an estimated total of 22,000 species
      have been classified. They are easily identified by their geniculate
      (elbowed) antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms
      their slender waists. Ants form colonies that range in size from a few
      dozen predatory individuals living in small natural cavities to highly
      organised colonies that may occupy large territories and consist of
      millions of individuals. Larger colonies consist of various castes of
      sterile, wingless females, most of which are workers (ergates), as well as
      soldiers (dinergates) and other specialised groups. Nearly alliant
      colonies also have some fertile males called \"drones\" and one or more
      fertile females called \"'queens\" (gynes). The colonies are described as
      superorganisms because the ants appear to operate as a @ unified entity,
      collectively working together to support. the colony. Fire ants Ants have
      colonised almost every landmass on Earth. The only places lacking
      indigenous ants are Antarctica and a few remote or inhospitable islands.
      Ants thrive in Scientific classification Domain: Eukaryota moist tropical
      ecosystems and may exceed the combined Kingdom: Animalia biomass of wild
      birds and mammals. Their success in so Arthropoda Phylum: many
      environments has been attributed to their social organisation and their
      ability to modify habitats, tap resources, and defend themselves. Their
      long co- evolution with other species has led to mimetic, Insecta Class:
      Order: Hymenoptera Infraorder: Aculeata commensal, parasitic, and

      been an inspiration and subject of study. Many human cultures make use of
      ants in cuisine, medication, and rites. Some species are valued in their
      role as biological pest control agents. Their ability to exploit resources
